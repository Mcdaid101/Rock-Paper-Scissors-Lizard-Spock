# Purpose
I built this website as my second project for the code institutes full stack development and e-commerce applications course. 
I built this website from scratch using the knowledge I gained from the course where I studied the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

You can find a link to the live website [here](https://mcdaid101.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/).	

## Tommy Keys Car Sales
![Website Mock Up](assets/images/readme-images/multi-device-generator.png)
This website was built for fans of the Big Bang Theory and Star trek. This fun online game of rock, paper, scissors incorporates the Star Trek character Spock and a lizard into the mix, giving the game many more outcomes. Many people will know this version of the game from the television series The Big Bang Theory.
<br>

# User Experience

3. I want users to be able to easily navigate the site. 
<br>

# Structure and Design  
Each page on the site has the same header with the Rock Paper Spock logo on it, the home page has a sign up button which brings you to the about page and a pop up modal which explains how the game works. Below the buttons on the home page lies the Game area which has the game's option buttons which are fully interactive along with the result of the player's choice and the computer's choice and the outcome of who won. At the very bottom of the page is where the player and the computer's scores are incremented. In the about page below the home button is a form where players can sign up to create an account and get emailed about future games made by the creator. 
<br>

## Website Structure 
1. Home page containing buttons to the about page and rules modal and the game itself and a score area.
2. About page contains form to sign up and create an account.
3. 404 page. 
<br>

## Colour
The website was designed using a similar color #b3e6f4 to that of the star trek character Spock's iconic blue jumper, who is a feature of this game. The box shadow used on the home and about page containers also uses a box shadow effect which is also blue in color adding to the spock theme. 
<br>

## Fonts
The sole font family used is imported from the Google Fonts website and is called 'orbitron', this font has been used extensively throughout the website as it looks like a traditional computer game style font and suits the theme of the website.

# Bugs 

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Text on certain pages was hard to read against the image background beneath it.  | Used the glass morphism generator code from Glass Ui to blur the background slightly making the text more readable. |
| The form and map on the Contact page were failing to fit on the page when viewed from a mobile |Changed the display to flex and used a media query to change the display from a column to a row. |
| The user was able to submit the contact form with nothing inputted to the text boxes.  | Added a required attribute to the input fields. |
| Youtube video failing to be responsive to any other device screen size than the one I had initially embedded it on. | Placed the Iframe within a container and gave it the position of relative and gave the Iframe itself a position of absolute, this made the youtube video responsive.  |
